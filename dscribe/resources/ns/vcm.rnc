## A checkpoint timing proposal from one task.  It may hold any number of
## checkpoint spans that the task could agree to (i.e. that it could retrieve
## the files for, and that do not break its consistency rules).  Each checkpoint
## is bounded by the current and previous (successful) job run's timestamps.
## A checkpoint is marked as interesting only if the task thinks it's worthwhile
## to checkpoint there, otherwise it's merely acceptable.  A checkpoint is selected
## if it falls within one acceptable span for each proposal element, and if at least
## one of those spans is interesting.  Otherwise, if there is at least one proposal
## with a postpone-until attribute, the job run is postponed until the latest of
## the postponement stamps.  Otherwise, the job run is abandoned until the next
## regularly scheduled execution.
