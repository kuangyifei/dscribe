	This is the central configuration file for the database. If the database

    the WEB-INF directory of the web application. Otherwise, the configuration
    is read from the directory specified by the exist.home system property.

    <!-- Configures the database backend:
        - database: 
            selects a database backend. Currently, "native" is the
            only valid setting.
        - files:
            path to the directory where database files are
            stored.
        - cacheSize:
            the maximum amount of memory to use for database page buffers.
            Each database file has an associated page buffer for B+-tree and
            data pages. However, the memory specified via cacheSize is shared 
            between all page buffers. It represents an absolute maximum, which
            would be occupied if all page buffers were completely full.
        - free_mem_min:
            minimum amount of free memory in percent during indexing. The
            database will start to flush its internal buffers whenever
            free memory drops below the specified limit.
        - pageSize: 
            the size of one page on the disk. This is the smallest unit 
            transferred from and to the database files. Should be a multiple of 
            the operating system's file system page size (usually 4096).

    - enable-xsl: 
        should the database evaluate XSL processing instructions
        when serializing documents?
    - indent:
        should the serializer pretty-print (indent) XML?
    - match-tagging-elements:
    - match-tagging-attributes:
        
    - add-exist-id:
        for debugging: add an exist:id attribute to every element, showing
        the internal node identifier (as a long int) assigned to this node.
        Possible values are: "none", "element", "all". "all" displays the node
        of every element node; "element" displays the id only for the root nodes
        of the returned XML fragments.

	<!-- During XUpdates, the database needs to do a partial reindex of the
		document whenever the internal node-id structure has changed. Reindex
		runs can occur quite frequently and slow down the XUpdate process.
		
		Frequent reindex runs can be avoided by leaving some space between the
		numeric identifiers assigned to every node. Future insertions will first
		fill up these spare identifiers, so no reindex is required.
		
		The "growth-factor" attribute determines the number of spare ids to be
		inserted whenever the node id scheme is recomputed after an XUpdate.
		Increase the setting to have less reindex runs. However, you have to
		be aware that leaving spare ids also limits the maximum size of a 
		document that can be indexed. 
		
		"enable-consistency-checks" is for debugging only. If the parameter
		is set to "yes", a consistency check will be run on every modified 
		document after every XUpdate request. It checks if the 
		persistent DOM is complete and all pointers in the structural
		index point to valid storage addresses containing valid nodes.
		
		"allowed-fragmentation" defines the maximum number of page splits allowed within a
		document before a defragmentation run will be triggered.

        Settings for the indexer:
        - suppress-whitespace
            should leading or trailing whitespace be removed from a text
            node? Set to "leading", "trailing", "both" or "none". Changing
            the parameter will only have an effect on newly loaded files, not
            old ones.
        - caseSensitive
            should equality comparisons between strings be case-sensitive or
            insensitive: "yes" or "no".
        - validation
            should XML source files be validated against a schema or DTD before
            storing them? The setting is passed to the XML parser. The actual
            effects depend on the parser you use. eXist comes with Xerces which can
            validate against both: schemas and DTDs. Possible values: "yes",
            "no", "auto". "auto" will leave validation to the parser.
        - stemming
            eXist includes a very simple english language stemmer, based on Porter's algorithm.
            Set the "stemming"-option to "true" if you would like to use stemming. This does
            only work for english.
        - index-depth
            defines the maximum nesting depth of nodes which will be indexed
            in the DOM index. Nodes below the specified nesting depth will
            not be indexed in the DOM file. This has only an effect when 
            retrieving query results or for some types of XPath subexpressions, like
            equality comparisons.
